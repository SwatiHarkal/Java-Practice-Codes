When a class has more than one method having the same name
but different in parameters, it is called method overloading in Java.

Argument type must be different (at least order) in overloading.

The signature of the overloaded method must be different.

In method overloading, the return type can be the same or different.

Method overloading is generally performed in the same class.

Private, static, and final method can be overloaded in Java.

In overloading, access modifiers can be anything or different.
