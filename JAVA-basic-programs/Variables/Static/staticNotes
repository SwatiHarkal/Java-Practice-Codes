static is a keyword

All objects of a class share same copy of static variables

To access static block/method we don't need an object of that class

in static method we can't access non-static/instance variables/fields directly
if we want to access then we need to create object of a class

no need to create a object to call static block, it will call independently.

static blocks => 1.does not have any name use only static keyword
                 2.no need to call it explicitly
                 3.when we want to execute any code before main method
                   starts execution we use statics block
                 4.all static blocks calls first in top to bottom order ten main method starts
                   execution
                 5. it gets executed only once by JVM when the class is loaded into memory by ClassLoader

static methods => 1. it has a name
                  2. need to call in main method but no need to create object
