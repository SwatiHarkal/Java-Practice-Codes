A static method (class method) cannot be overridden in Java.
But if a static method defined in the parent class is redefined in a child class,
the child class’s method hides the method defined in the parent class.

This mechanism is called method hiding in Java or function hiding.

In method hiding concept, the method call depends on the reference type.
It is also known as compile-time polymorphism.

Rules:
1. Both parent and child class methods must be static.
