When the method of super/parent class  is overridden in the child/subclass to
provide more specific implementation, it is called method overriding.

so child class has must be same methods signature, return type, list of parameters,
access modifiers

When to Use Method Overriding in Java?
Method overriding in Java programming is useful when a subclass needs to provide
a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
It enables runtime polymorphism.

allows behavior to be customized in subclasses without modifying
the existing superclass code.

Rules:
1.The name of subclass method must have exactly the same name as the superclass method name.
2.The parameter list (types or order) of the subclass method must be the same
  as the superclass method parameters. In overriding, method name and argument types
  must be matched. If the method name is the same but the parameters differ,
  it’s method overloading, not overriding.
3.Must be Is-A relationship (Inheritance). Overriding is only possible through inheritance.
  The subclass must inherit the method from the superclass.
4.Subclass method’s return type must be the same as the superclass method return type.
  But this rule is applicable until the Java 1.4 version only.
  From the Java 1.5 version onwards, covariant return types are also allowed.
5.Subclass method’s access modifier must be the same or more permissive than the superclass
  method access modifier. In other words, the overriding method cannot be
  more restrictive than the overridden method. It can be the same or less restrictive.
parent => child
public => public
protected => public, protected
default  => default, public, protected
private =>private methods can not be override,cause it is accessible only within same class.
