what is Constructor in Java?
=> type of method or block of code, used to initialize an Object of a class.
=>

Why we need Constructor?


difference between Constructor and method?
=> NO return type for Constructor
=> class name and Constructor name must be same.
=> no need to call Constructor of a class, it will get called as soon as we create an Object.

Types of Constructors
1) No-arg constructor
2) Parameterized Constructor

Note: Even when we don't provide any Constructor in class, JVM will provide default constructor.

Note: First line in any Constructor is a call to Parent class No-arg Constructor,
      No need to add this line cause JVM calls by default for no-args constructor
      super()

this => we can use this within same class only.
     => we can use super in IS-A relation only when we have one class for extends another class
     => if we used this then we can't use super
     => if we used super then we can't use this
     => first line is always for this/super keyword



No-arg vs default constructor
=> we create no-arg constructor
=> when user doesn't add or explicit any constructor in class then JVM calls/provide default constructor

Constructor Chaining

this  => current class methods/constructors
super => parent/super class methods/constructors


Types of Memories
1) Heap: Non-primitive types stores in heap
2) Stack: Primitives types stores in stack
