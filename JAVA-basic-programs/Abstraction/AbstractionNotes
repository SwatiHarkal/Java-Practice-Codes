why we need abstraction?



how to achieve abstraction?
1) abstract class
2) interface


Abstract class rules:

1) It's not mandatory to have abstract method in abstract class.

2) If we define a single abstract method in a class, then that class must be an abstract class.

3) We can not create an object of abstract class.

4) If one abstract class extends another abstract class,
then it's not mandatory for that child class to provide method implementations of
abstract methods of super class.

5) If concrete/non-abstract class extends  abstract class,
then its  mandatory for that child class to provide method implementations of
abstract methods of super class.
