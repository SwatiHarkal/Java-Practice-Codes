What is Interface?
=>  An Interface is an abstract tpe that defines a sett of methods.
=>  It is a 100% abstraction, and used to achieve multiple inheritance
=>  If we implements class from interfaces then need to implement all present abstract methods to concrete class


relationship between interface and class
1) 1 class extends 1 class
2) 1 class implements multiple interfaces
3) 1 interface extends multiple interfaces
