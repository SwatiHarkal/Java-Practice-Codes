If we create a different objects it creates separate instances for each

To access instance methods we need an object of that class

instance blocks => 1.does not have any name no need to add any keyword as well
                   2.no need to call it explicitly
                   3.when we want to execute any code after object creation but
                     before constructor get called we use instance blocks
                   4.all instance blocks calls first in top to bottom order then main method
                     starts execution
                   5. instance blocks are executed every time an object of the class
                      is created. means it's depend on how many objects we are creating
                      e.g if we create 2 objects instance blocks executes 2 times

executiopn steps
static block => instance blocks => main method

instance methods => 1. it has a name
                    2. need to call in main method and need to create object of class
